# Attributes, events, and attributes with two-way-binding

## Legend:

- [(attribute)] describes an attribute with two-way-binding
- [attribute] means that PDF-viewer reacts when the attribute changes
- (attribute) means an event is raised when the user changes a setting
- attribute (without special characters) means the attribute is used at load time only. Subsequent changes are ignored.

More precisely, the all the space to the bottom of the window. If that's less then 100 pixel, the height is set to 100 pixel. Note that this is just an initial setting. It doesn't change when the window is resized.                                                                                                                                             |

If you pass the wrong password, a red error message claiming "corrupt pdf file" is show in below the toolbar. Caveat: the password must be a string. During my test I accidentially used a numerical value. This fails even if the password consists only of digits. Please not that the password is stored main memory without encryption. If you're really serious about (advanced) hackers, this might be a security issue.                                                                                                             |

If not undefined: Set the zoom level of the page, no matter which zoom level was previously configured. Legal values are [zoom]="'auto'", ="'page-actual'", ="'page-fit'", ="'page-width'", or ="50" (or any other percentage). Numbers are always considered percentages; the trailing "%" character is optional. This attribute supports two-way binding. [(zoom)]="zoomAttribute" updates the variable `zoomAttribute` each time the user changes the zoom setting. This is useful to use the same zoom accross multiple PDF viewer instances or PDF document. |
