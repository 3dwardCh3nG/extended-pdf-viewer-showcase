# Attributes, events, and attributes with two-way-binding

## Legend:

- [(attribute)] describes an attribute with two-way-binding
- [attribute] means that PDF-viewer reacts when the attribute changes
- (attribute) means an event is raised when the user changes a setting
- attribute (without special characters) means the attribute is used at load time only. Subsequent changes are ignored.

| (currentZoomFactor)          |       n/a       | fires each time the viewer changes the zoom level. The parameter is the scale factor (not the percentage, nor one of the string "auto", "page fit", "page width" or "original size"). This event seems to fire often enough to make it reliable for detecting the current zoom factor all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [height]                     |   (see text)    | define the height of the PDF window. By default, it's 100%. On most web pages, this results in a height of 0 pixels. In this case, the height is set to fill all the available space. More precisely, the all the space to the bottom of the window. If that's less then 100 pixel, the height is set to 100 pixel. Note that this is just an initial setting. It doesn't change when the window is resized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [ignoreResponsiveCSS]        |   (see text)    | Hint: see the live demo at <a target="#" href="https://pdfviewer.net/responsive-design">https://pdfviewer.net/responsive-design</a>. CSS is not flexible enough to embed the PDF viewer without retaining responsive design. If the PDF viewer doesn't have the full window width available, this flag is automatically set to "true". In this case, the standard CSS rules of the viewer are ignored in favor of dynamic styles defined by JavaScript. The disadvantage of this approach is that you can't override these rules by custom CSS rules. Hence you can deactivate the responsive JavaScript engine by setting this flag to "false". That's also the default value if the PDF viewer spans the entire width of the window. In this case, the default CSS rules define the responsive design. |
| listenToURL                  |      false      | deactivates the URL listener of the PDF viewer. You can set it to "true" to allow for anchor tags like "#page=23" or "#nameddest=chapter_3". Only activate this flag if you don't use the anchor to encode the URLs for the router.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| delayFirstView               |        0        | Number of milliseconds to wait between initializing the PDF viewer and loading the PDF file. Most users can let this parameter safely at it's default value of zero. Set this to 1000 or higher if you run into timing problems (typically caused by loading the locale files after the PDF files, so they are not available when the PDF viewer is initialized).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| [(zoom)]                     |    undefined    | `[zoom]="undefined"` (default value): use the zoom level `"auto"`.

Legal values are `[zoom]="'auto'"`, `="'page-actual'"`, `="'page-fit'"`, `="'page-width'"`, or `="50"` (or any other percentage). Numbers are always considered percentages; the trailing "%" character is optional. This attribute supports two-way binding. `[(zoom)]="zoomAttribute"` updates the variable `zoomAttribute` each time the user changes the zoom setting. This is useful to use the same zoom accross multiple PDF viewer instances or PDF document.                                                                                                                                                       |
